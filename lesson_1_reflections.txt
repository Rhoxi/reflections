How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows where the changes are, and since the bug is introduced by change
	it helps locate the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    A lot of time saved in looking for bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: You only have working versions, you do not have an extreme amount 
         of version files lying around 
    con: You have to remember to save it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It must depend on which type of work they are designed to save - 
    if different files are interdependent (as often with code) it is smart to 
    save the files together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : shows all commits made to the repository
    git diff [old file] [new file] : shows all changes between two files,
             added lnes in green and deleted lines in red


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always revert to an old working file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I try with the astoroids again
